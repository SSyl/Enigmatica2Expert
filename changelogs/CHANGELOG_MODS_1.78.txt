			* Added GunpowderLib as a required dependency, refactored some codes to call methods from new library
			* Requires Forge 2816 or above for a change in the item rarity system
			* Added support for Ender IO Endergy, along with 6 new exchangers (Crude steel, Energetic silver, Vivid alloy, Crystalline alloy, Melodic alloy and Stellar alloy)
			* Added localized texts for harvest level 5, 6 and 7
			* Adjusted energy costs for most of the powered exchangers, a manual config reset is required in order to receive the changes
			* Optimized tons of internal codes
